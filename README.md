===============

Useful Add On to eGIT

GitHub becoming the most popular Version of Git, we have a few features lined up to support GitHub
1.Raising PullRequest from Eclipse between 2 Remotes
  - Earlier Implemented as Gimmick which would open the URL in a Browser and you could click on Create PullRequest
  - Now the Feature is extended and implemented using GitHub Mylyn Connector, so that you can raise PullRequest from Eclipse itself in the true sense.

2.Fork Visualisation
  - Select a Branch in the Github Repositories View and See the Forks of the Selected Repo Graphically and Hierarchially.

Features to follow
  - Other GitHub Operations thru GUI.
