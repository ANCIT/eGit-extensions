Useful Add On to eGIT

GitHub becoming the most popular Version of Git, we have a few features lined up to support GitHub
1.Raising PullRequest from Eclipse between 2 Remotes
  - Earlier Implemented as Gimmick which would open the URL in a Browser and you could click on Create PullRequest
  - Now the Feature is extended and implemented using GitHub Mylyn Connector, so that you can raise PullRequest from Eclipse itself in the true sense.

Features to follow
2. Fork Visualisation
3. Other GitHub Operations thru GUI.
